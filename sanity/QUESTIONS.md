# Outstanding questions

- What is 'string-formatted' and what Sanity type most closely matches?
- Which string fields have set selections? (language, moderationState, editorialType, origin)
- Should each object with a 'role' be a document?
- Is 'slug' type valid for urlAlias?
- urlAlias has different types between 'story' and 'person', assuming that's intentional?
