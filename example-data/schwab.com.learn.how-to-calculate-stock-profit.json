For stock investors, measuring and tracking performance—derived from profit and loss—is the financial version of the foldout map.</p><p>The simplest way to track performance is to mark your starting account balance and then compare it to your current balance, excluding any funds deposited or withdrawn, on whatever period you wish, such as daily, monthly, quarterly, etc. Many investors typically start the New Year by noting their account balance and checking it periodically to measure how they're doing throughout the year.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

You can see the current price for any stock or option in your position on the&nbsp;<strong>Position Statement</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P/L Open</strong> is the amount of money made or lost on your position since the inception of the trade. You can see the execution price for any stock or option in your position by going to the&nbsp;<strong>Monitor</strong>&nbsp;tab and selecting the&nbsp;<strong>P/L Open</strong>&nbsp;dollar amount.</p><p><strong>P/L Year-to-Date (YTD)</strong> is the amount of money made or lost in a particular underlying security in the current calendar year. It includes the P/L for all open positions and any closed positions made for a specific stock or index done in a calendar year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P/L %</strong> calculates the percentage of money made or lost as a function of your execution price. This takes the P/L Open as the numerator and your execution price as the denominator. Keep in mind, when it comes to options, this will only calculate the P/L of single options and does not include spreads.</p><p>These four unique calculations can be used to measure your portfolio in various ways. For example, let's say on the first trading day of the year, you start with $100,000 in your account and no open positions. You then buy 500 shares each of QRS and XYZ stock, both of which are trading for $10. Assuming both stocks immediately go up $1, your P/L would look like this&nbsp;(please be mindful that this example excludes commissions and transaction fees).</p>",

With open positions, you can create subgroups focused on concepts like \"short-term,\" \"long-term,\" \"speculative,\" \"value,\" or any number of criteria, and then add the appropriate positions to each. This helps keep your positions organized and gives you the ability to track performance on each subgroup separate from one another.</p><p>For closed positions, one way to track performance is to download them into a spreadsheet and sort profitable trades from unprofitable ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracking investment performance can be one of the more powerful things you can do as an investor.
